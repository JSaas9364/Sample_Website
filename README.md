# Sample Website (WIP)

A basic front-end project built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

This is a work-in-progress, with plans to integrate:

- **React** for dynamic components âœ…
- **SQL** for backend database integration âœ…
- **Node.js** and **Express** for server-side logic âœ…
- **REST API** for data handling âœ…
- **Authentication (OAuth / JWT)** for user login system

ğŸ”§ Focus: Practicing modern web development workflows and in-demand full-stack skills.
    Current authentication uses JWT stored in localStorage for simplicity.
